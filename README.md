# OPTIMISATION OF THE NAIVE NxN MATRIX MULTIPLICATION ALGORITHM

The naive matrix multiplication, is an algorithm known of multiplying 2 matrix. Resulting a matrix. The major problem it has is having a compelxity of O(N^3), which is the worst case. 
Some algorithms were suggested to reduce this time, convergin to O(N^2), which is the not attended ideal case. With simple modification to the naive algorithm, i was able to reduce it's time to O(N^3/2) , means the half. And the case O(N^2) is true for a 3x3 Multiplication. 
The fact is using two pointers of sum instead of one, and having an eye on the last column. In the case of a N = 2k + 1, the complexity is of O(N^2(N-1)/2), for N = 2k it's O(N^3/2)
